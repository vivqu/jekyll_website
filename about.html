<p class="subtitle mb-7">Full-time engineer ðŸ‘¾| Part-time agent of chaos ðŸŽ¢</p>
<p>Hello there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet.</p>
<p><b>By day, I am a software engineer and product thinker.</b> I am a senior mobile engineer at <a href="https://www.pathlight.com/" target="_blank">Pathlight</a>, 
    and have previously worked for
    Pinterest and Firefly Health, building things in iOS and React Native. You can persuade me to deviate to other languages (like 
    Python) with candy bribes. One of the
    hardest projects I've worked on was evaluating React Native for Pinterest's
    tech stack, you can read about it <a
        href="https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/supporting-react-native-at-pinterest-f8c2233f90e6"
        target="_blank">here</a>. I'm proud of how that one turned out.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>I currently live in San Francisco</b>. I coexist in the universe with my partner and our border collie doggo, 
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/knucklesthepup/" target="_blank">Knuckles</a>. Previously we lived in Tokyo. 
    Prior to that I studied computer science at Princeton University.</p>
<p><b>I grew up in the great swamplands of Orlando, Florida</b>. My childhood also left me with an abiding love of 
    baby alligators, sweltering summers, and Disney World. Read my magna opera<sup>1</sup> about 
    <a href="/blog/2018/02/12/disney-world-tracking/">Disney's data tracking</a> or 
    <a href="/blog/2018/06/01/disney-tips/">how to optimize your trip to Disney World</a>.</p>
<p class="mb-3"><b>When I'm not working, I exist as an interest probability cloud</b>. Upon observation or interaction, my current state will 
    collapse to one of the following: drinking coffee, practicing handstands/splits, enjoying musical theater, 
    reading sci-fi and fantasy novels, or reviewing Japanese vocabulary. For best results, use the Large Hadron Collider 
    to take measurements.

<p class="f6"><sup>1</sup>: Apparently this is the plural of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/magnum_opus" target="_blank">magnum opus</a>.</p>
