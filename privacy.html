    <p>By contacting me through email or a private message on any social media, you agree to engage in polite and
        respectful dialogue. I will not share your name or contact information without your prior consent.

    <p>However if you act like a jerk and do not follow the guidelines above, I reserve the right to call you out

        I take your privacy seriously. In order to track basic web traffic analytics, I use a cookieless method for
        Google Analytics on this website. It
        uses a fingerprinting technique that anonymously identifies web browsers using the region or general location of
        a
        computer or device accessing the internet, browser type, operating system, and other statistical
        information. No
        IP addresses are stored in Google Analytics. You can read more in the software license I've included at the
        bottom of the page.

    <p>This website is built using Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages.</p>
    <p>Please <a href="mailto:hello@vivqu.com" target="_blank">email me</a> if you have any questions.</p>
