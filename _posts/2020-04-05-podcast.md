# The "German Forest"

In Jessica Abel's excelled illustrated guide [Out on the Wire](https://www.amazon.com/Out-Wire-Storytelling-Secrets-Masters/dp/0385348436), radio producers discuss various aspects of their craft. One of the best stories is told by _Radiolab_ host Jad Abrumad. At the beginning of his career, he was tasked to work on an hour-long segment of [Wagner's Ring Cycle](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/gp-at-the-met-wagner-e2-80-99s-ring-cycle-the-story-of-the-ring-opera-synopses/1377/). It's an awe-inspiring and terrifying piece for even professional musicians to play, "an eighteen-hour cycle of operas that tries to encompass the totality of European art in one work."

Abrumad, blissfully ignorant of the immensity of the project, quickly learned his mistake when everything started falling apart:

> Fast-forward a couple months, I had missed four deadlines, I’m on the verge of getting fired, and I haven’t slept for four days. I had the pressure of ideas that I just couldn’t reach, I had the pressure of being a newbie and talking to people who were very sophisticated. And I had the pressure of deadlines that were going “splat!” left, right, and center.

This feeling of insecurity and overwhelming anxiety is so common in the storytelling process that the _Radiolab_ team has a name for it: **the German forest**.

The forest is actually an essential part of the creative process, as Abrumad reveals:

> When I head the [Wagner thing](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/91750-the-ring-and-i) on the radio later, I was like, “Whoa, somewhere in the middle of that trauma, I think I found my voice. There’s a real correlation between time spent in the German forest and these moments of emergence. <br/><br/>
> And to be clear, the German forest changes. That sense of, the work is just too big to put my head around this, how am I gonna do this, that never changes. But what does change is that the terror gets reframed for you, because now, you’ve made it out a few times. You can see over the treetops, and into the future, to where, there you are, you’re still alive there, you’re still alive. So you begin to recognize the German forest for what it is. It’s actually a tool. It’s the place you have to go to hear the next version of yourself.

I can remember clearly how lost I felt when I started the podcast. Not only were there many logistics to figure out, like equipment and sound-proofing and editing software, but also I knew my storytelling style and voice were complete garbage. I wanted to make a podcast because I love podcasts, so even a few episodes in, I still felt intense dissatisfaction with the [gap between my taste and creative output](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wLP0izeJE). I was distinctly aware of the kind of podcast I'd like to make and had no clue on how to get there. I was starting to take my first few steps into the German forest and it did not feel good.

Now, a year and a half later, I've finished fourteen episodes of the [San Fransokyo Podcast](https://www.sanfransokyopodcast.com/). I've learned so much about podcasting and storytelling, and I have made it out of the German forest alive. Granted, it's a very low-stakes forest compared to Abrumad's, but I count it as a win nonetheless. And now that I'm officially retiring the podcast, I thought it would be a good time to do some reflection.

I've also talked to quite a few friends who are interested in starting their own podcasts. For one reason or another, they haven't started on these projects yet. So I thought I could take all the information I've collected and turn it into a resource for them. I'm also planning on making another podcast someday, so this will be record and reminder for my future self as well.

# Setting up the podcast

## Research and planning

Here are some of the resources I used to prepare for the podcast. In terms of concrete guides, I looked for getting started guides and articles about podcast basics. Here are a few I checked out:

- [Podcasting Basics, Part 1: Voice Recording Gear](https://transom.org/2015/podcasting-basics-part-1-voice-recording-gear/)
- [Podcasting Made Simple - The Complete Setup (Including Taking Phone Calls)](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/podcasting-made-simple-the-complete-setup-including_b_5894f3c4e4b02bbb1816ba2d?guccounter=1)

I loved learning how experts construct compelling audio stories. I can't stress enough how highly I recommend [Out on the Wire: The Storytelling Secrets of the New Masters of Radio](https://www.amazon.com/Out-Wire-Storytelling-Secrets-Masters-ebook/dp/B00QE1A7AC/ref=pd_sbsd_14_1/144-9678092-9356215?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00QE1A7AC&pd_rd_r=3d79efc4-fbaa-4cdd-9c48-7797665166f3&pd_rd_w=SVIGw&pd_rd_wg=1Pe2S&pf_rd_p=2c2d0d3b-b3c5-4110-93fa-2c1270309ac1&pf_rd_r=SXRT90PHBPF55ZNZ9T6V&psc=1&refRID=SXRT90PHBPF55ZNZ9T6V). And of course, podcasts themselves are also the perfect medium to hear from the masters directly. I referenced the following episodes for meta-aspects about podcasting:

- [Ira Glass: The Man Who Launched a Thousand Podcasts](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/without-fail/brhj37) on [Without Fail](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/without-fail)
- [Making Radiolab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/91746-making-radio-lab) on [Radiolab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab)
 - [The Voice in Your Head - A Tribute to Joe Frank](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/voice-your-head-tribute-joe-frank) on [Radiolab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab)
- [Finding My Voice](https://www.imaginaryworldspodcast.org/finding-my-voice.html) on [Imaginary Worlds](https://www.imaginaryworldspodcast.org/home.html)

In all honesty, I probably could have done much more prepwork. I quickly transitioned to begin working on the first episode because I was impatient to create some tangible output. It was easier to dive straight into the German forest and learn through trial and error, rather than trying to get it perfect from the beginning.

## Equipment

All my choices for equipment and software were motivated by convenience, rather than optimizing for the best-in-class tooling. This was a great approach to get me past the initial setup phase, where it can be easy to get stuck due to analysis paralysis.

Here is the breakdown of my podcast equipment:

- Single-person microphone - [Blue Yeti USB Microphone](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N1YPXW2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ($130) with [windscreen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LXOJZJ9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ($7) and [pop filter](https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-Flexible-Gooseneck-Stabilizing-Earamble/dp/B06WVFRW4H/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=pop+filter&qid=1586718788&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExOUUyTTlNWDRETkg0JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDkyNjUwMTRFWU1VVzU2WkpRQiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMjE1MzQ0MktMV1ZUVDlPSVomd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl) ($9)
- Audio mixer - [Behringer Xenyx Q1204USB](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CTKI5SS/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ($220)
- Interview microphone (x2) - [Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB/XLR Microphone](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QJOZS4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ($70) with [windscreen](https://www.amazon.com/Shappy-Windscreen-Technica-Condenser-Microphones/dp/B073TTZJPB/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=microphone+windscreen+condenser+atr2100&qid=1586718762&sr=8-2) ($8), [pop filter](https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-Flexible-Gooseneck-Stabilizing-Earamble/dp/B06WVFRW4H/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=pop+filter&qid=1586718788&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExOUUyTTlNWDRETkg0JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDkyNjUwMTRFWU1VVzU2WkpRQiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMjE1MzQ0MktMV1ZUVDlPSVomd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl) ($9), and [XLR cables](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Male-Female-Microphone-Cable/dp/B01JNLTTKS/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=xlr+cable&qid=1586718857&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExQUhYVkhYMENJUVQwJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNzkyMjEwMThIV0YyMFRFMUg4TyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMDQ3NzA5MjIyT1oxTjVDUkdBUCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) ($8)
- Portable recorder - [Zoom H2N Recorder](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CQ2ZY6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ($170) with [accessory pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CQ30A4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ($36) and [windscreen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IBI58RW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ($11)

While this seems like a lot of equipment, I didn't end up using all of it. For instance, I originally purchased the portable recorder with the intention to record a lot of b-roll background audio. I kept forgetting to bring the recorder along or I would end up not using the audio I did record. I would recommend skipping the portable recorder unless you find yourself really needing it.

The audio mixer was actually the opposite case. I originally purchased one microphone (Blue Yeti USB Microphone) and thought I could use it for all types of recordings. It ended up being suboptimal at capturing high quality audio of two people and I struggled with editing together the audio. Since the podcast ultimately coalesced around conversations between me and Dru by the third episode, I needed a good two-person setup. Using two USB microphones often results in [audio drift](https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/610nb0/tech_problem_how_to_sync_two_microphones/), so I finally decided to commit to XLR-mixer equipment.

In general, I was surprised by the high price of entry-level podcasting equipment. I think spending a few hundred dollars is probably necessary for decent quality audio, though it was still quite sensitive to ambient environmental noise. I would definitely consider upgrading the equipment and investing in some soundproofing for the next podcast.

## Editing software

In terms of the editing process, my setup was dead simple: 

- Editing software - [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) (Free)
- Music - [Youtube Audio Library](https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music?nv=1) (Free)

I learned how to use Audacity for a high school project and the interface has not changed in more than a decade. And since Audacity accomplished the bare minimum I needed for editing, I didn't bother learning more professional software like Pro Tools or Logic Pro. I suspect that I could have cut down a lot of my editing time with more advanced software features, so I definitely plan on investing more time in learning upgraded software the next time around.

# Finding your voice + podcast style

Quote from Radio: An Illustrated Guide:

> Never stop thinking about pacing. If an answer seems boring, politely move things along. Charm. Cajole. React with amazement when they say something amazing. Laugh if they’re funny. Don’t forget that YOU are part of the interview.

## Music

Out on the Wire quote:

> Music is the frame around the picture. It makes it more real than real. More than just two guys talking.
