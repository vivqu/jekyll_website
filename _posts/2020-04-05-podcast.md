# The German forest üå≤

In Jessica Abel's excelled illustrated guide [Out on the Wire](https://www.amazon.com/Out-Wire-Storytelling-Secrets-Masters/dp/0385348436), radio producers discuss various aspects of their craft. One of the best stories is told by _Radiolab_ host Jad Abrumad. At the beginning of his career, he was tasked to work on an hour-long segment of [Wagner's Ring Cycle](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/gp-at-the-met-wagner-e2-80-99s-ring-cycle-the-story-of-the-ring-opera-synopses/1377/). It's an awe-inspiring and terrifying piece for even professional musicians to play, "an eighteen-hour cycle of operas that tries to encompass the totality of European art in one work."

Abrumad, blissfully ignorant of the immensity of the project, quickly learned his mistake when everything started falling apart:

> Fast-forward a couple months, I had missed four deadlines, I‚Äôm on the verge of getting fired, and I haven‚Äôt slept for four days. I had the pressure of ideas that I just couldn‚Äôt reach, I had the pressure of being a newbie and talking to people who were very sophisticated. And I had the pressure of deadlines that were going ‚Äúsplat!‚Äù left, right, and center.

This feeling of insecurity and overwhelming anxiety is so common in the storytelling process that the _Radiolab_ team has a name for it: **the German forest**.

<br />

The forest is actually an essential part of the creative process, as Abrumad reveals:

> When I head the [Wagner thing](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/91750-the-ring-and-i) on the radio later, I was like, ‚ÄúWhoa, somewhere in the middle of that trauma, I think I found my voice. There‚Äôs a real correlation between time spent in the German forest and these moments of emergence. <br/><br/>
> And to be clear, the German forest changes. That sense of, the work is just too big to put my head around this, how am I gonna do this, that never changes. But what does change is that the terror gets reframed for you, because now, you‚Äôve made it out a few times. You can see over the treetops, and into the future, to where, there you are, you‚Äôre still alive there, you‚Äôre still alive. So you begin to recognize the German forest for what it is. It‚Äôs actually a tool. It‚Äôs the place you have to go to hear the next version of yourself.

I can remember clearly how lost I felt when I started the podcast. Not only were there many logistics I had to figure out, like what equipment and editing software to use, but also I knew my storytelling style and voice were nonexistent. I wanted to make a podcast because I love podcasts, so even a few episodes in, I still felt intense dissatisfaction with the [gap between my taste and creative output](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wLP0izeJE). I was distinctly aware of the kind of podcast I'd like to make and had no clue on how to get there. I was starting to take my first few steps into the German forest and it did not feel good.

Now, a year and a half later, I've finished fourteen episodes of the [San Fransokyo Podcast](https://www.sanfransokyopodcast.com/). I've learned so much about podcasting and storytelling, and I have made it out of the German forest alive. Granted, it's a very low-stakes forest compared to Abrumad's, but I count it as a win nonetheless. And now that I'm officially retiring the podcast, I thought it would be a good time to do some reflection.

<br />

I've also talked to quite a few friends who are interested in starting their own podcasts. For one reason or another, they haven't started on these projects yet. So I thought I could take all the information I've collected and turn it into a resource for them. I'm also planning on making another podcast someday, so this will be record and reminder for my future self as well.

<h2 id="research">Research and planning ‚úçüèª</h2>

Here are some of the resources I used to prepare for the podcast. In terms of concrete guides, I looked for getting started guides and articles about podcast basics. Here are a few I checked out:

- [Podcasting Basics, Part 1: Voice Recording Gear](https://transom.org/2015/podcasting-basics-part-1-voice-recording-gear/)
- [Podcasting Made Simple - The Complete Setup (Including Taking Phone Calls)](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/podcasting-made-simple-the-complete-setup-including_b_5894f3c4e4b02bbb1816ba2d?guccounter=1)

I loved learning how experts construct compelling audio stories. I can't stress enough how highly I recommend [Out on the Wire: The Storytelling Secrets of the New Masters of Radio](https://www.amazon.com/Out-Wire-Storytelling-Secrets-Masters-ebook/dp/B00QE1A7AC/ref=pd_sbsd_14_1/144-9678092-9356215?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00QE1A7AC&pd_rd_r=3d79efc4-fbaa-4cdd-9c48-7797665166f3&pd_rd_w=SVIGw&pd_rd_wg=1Pe2S&pf_rd_p=2c2d0d3b-b3c5-4110-93fa-2c1270309ac1&pf_rd_r=SXRT90PHBPF55ZNZ9T6V&psc=1&refRID=SXRT90PHBPF55ZNZ9T6V). And of course, podcasts themselves are also the perfect medium to hear from the masters directly. I listened to the following episodes for helpful advice on different aspects of podcasting:

<br />
In all honesty, I probably could have done much more prepwork. I quickly transitioned to begin working on the first episode because I was impatient to create some tangible output. It was easier to dive straight into the German forest and learn through trial and error, rather than trying to get it perfect from the beginning.

<h2 id="equipment">Equipment üéô</h2>

All my choices for equipment and software were motivated by convenience, rather than optimizing for the best-in-class tooling. This was a great approach to get me past the initial setup phase, where it can be easy to get stuck due to analysis paralysis.

Here is the breakdown of my podcast equipment:

- Single-person microphone - [Blue Yeti USB Microphone](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N1YPXW2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ($130) with [windscreen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LXOJZJ9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ($7) and [pop filter](https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-Flexible-Gooseneck-Stabilizing-Earamble/dp/B06WVFRW4H/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=pop+filter&qid=1586718788&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExOUUyTTlNWDRETkg0JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDkyNjUwMTRFWU1VVzU2WkpRQiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMjE1MzQ0MktMV1ZUVDlPSVomd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl) (\$9)
- Audio mixer - [Behringer Xenyx Q1204USB](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CTKI5SS/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (\$220)
- Interview microphone (x2) - [Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB/XLR Microphone](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QJOZS4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ($70) with [windscreen](https://www.amazon.com/Shappy-Windscreen-Technica-Condenser-Microphones/dp/B073TTZJPB/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=microphone+windscreen+condenser+atr2100&qid=1586718762&sr=8-2) ($8), [pop filter](https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-Flexible-Gooseneck-Stabilizing-Earamble/dp/B06WVFRW4H/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=pop+filter&qid=1586718788&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExOUUyTTlNWDRETkg0JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDkyNjUwMTRFWU1VVzU2WkpRQiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMjE1MzQ0MktMV1ZUVDlPSVomd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl) ($9), and [XLR cables](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Male-Female-Microphone-Cable/dp/B01JNLTTKS/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=xlr+cable&qid=1586718857&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExQUhYVkhYMENJUVQwJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNzkyMjEwMThIV0YyMFRFMUg4TyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMDQ3NzA5MjIyT1oxTjVDUkdBUCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) ($8)
- Portable recorder - [Zoom H2N Recorder](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CQ2ZY6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ($170) with [accessory pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CQ30A4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ($36) and [windscreen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IBI58RW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (\$11)

While this seems like a lot of equipment, I didn't end up using all of it. For instance, I originally purchased the portable recorder with the intention to record a lot of b-roll background audio. I kept forgetting to bring the recorder along or I would end up not using the audio I did record. I would recommend skipping the portable recorder unless you find yourself really needing it.

The audio mixer was actually the opposite case. I originally purchased one microphone (Blue Yeti USB Microphone) and thought I could use it for all types of recordings. It ended up being suboptimal at capturing high quality audio of two people and I struggled with editing together the audio. Since the podcast ultimately centered on conversations between me and Dru by the third episode, I needed a good two-person setup. Using two USB microphones often results in [audio drift](https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/610nb0/tech_problem_how_to_sync_two_microphones/), so I finally decided to commit to XLR-mixer setup.

In general, I was surprised by the high price of entry-level podcasting equipment. I think spending a few hundred dollars is probably necessary for decent quality audio, though my setup is still quite sensitive to ambient environmental noise. I would definitely consider upgrading the equipment and investing in soundproofing my recording area for the next podcast.

<h2 id="editing-software">Editing software üíªüéß</h2>

In terms of the editing process, my setup was dead simple:

- Editing software - [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) (Free)
- Music - [Jamendo](https://www.jamendo.com/start) (Free, with licensing options) and [Youtube Audio Library](https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music?nv=1) (Free)

I learned how to use Audacity a long time ago so it was the easiest editing software to start with quickly. It fulfilled the bare minimum I needed for editing so I didn't bother learning more professional software like Pro Tools or Logic Pro. I suspect that I could have cut down a lot of my editing time with more advanced software features, although I haven't done enough research to confirm if this is the case. I definitely plan on investing more time in learning upgraded software the next time around.

*The interface for [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) hasn't changed since high school.*

Music was a pretty defining part of my podcast style, which I'll go into more detail in a [following section](#musical-framing). I was able to find great artists and tracks for free, a fabulous outcome considering I was not generating any revenue from podcasting. I am definitely be interested in purchasing licensed professional music for my next podcast, such as the [Sono Sanctus](http://www.sonosanctus.com/home) music library, which is used to great effect in the [Imaginary Worlds podcast](https://www.imaginaryworldspodcast.org/).

<h2 id="hosting">Hosting and content services üìàü§≥üèª</h2>

Last but not least, I had to figure out how to host the podcast RSS feed and other miscellaneous content. The services I used were:

- Domain name - [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) (\$12/year)
- Podcast hosting and blog - [Squarespace](https://www.sanfransokyopodcast.com/) (\$12/mo)
- Podcast analytics - [Podtrac](https://podtrac.com/) (Free)
- Social media - [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sanfransokyopodcast/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sanfransokyopod)

I thought Squarespace was a slam-dunk choice, considering that it could take care of both my website and podcast hosting needs at the same time. Squarespace takes care of a lot of the annoying website setup, making it easier for me to get the whole production up and running faster. Plus, I figured that Squarespace had good podcast support since they advertise all the time on podcast shows.

<br />

*Taking a deeper look at Squarespace reveals pretty big gaps in their podcasting support.*

<br />

Unfortunately, Squarespace was not the ideal podcast hosting service. The podcast features are sorely lacking, missing analytics around critical metrics like podcast downloads or listener demographics. Squarespace is primarily a website creation service, so the data they provide is focused on the most useful information to monitor your website growth.

Squarespace does provide RSS subscriber stats, but this number is [severely overinflated](https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/aotui7/whats_the_deal_with_squarespace_rss_subscribers/) in the case of podcasting. Starting with episode 5, I added a separate analytics service ([Podtrac](https://podtrac.com/)) which gave me the actual listener data I needed. I wish I had realized this earlier since I don't have accurate information for those earliest episodes.

In general, I don't think Squarespace is a particular good fit for my needs. My podcast was a finite project, so the \$12 per month cost is pretty steep to simply keep up the RSS feed now that I'm not generating any more new content. Plus, as an experienced software engineer, I can build and host a website at almost no cost using free, open-source tools like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I'm planning on migrating off of Squarespace and see no benefit to using it for future podcasting projects.

I continue to struggle with the marketing aspects for all of my projects. I tried to copy the social media channels of my favorite podcasts, to little success. I found that the podcast's [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/sanfransokyopodcast/) was the easiest to consistently maintain. I quickly abandoned the Twitter account because I am bad at Twitter in general. I definitely want to invest more energy learning about effective marketing for my future projects, podcast or not.

> Nobody tells people who are beginners, [...] all of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. [...] There's a gap -- for the first couple years you're making stuff, what you're making isn't so good. It's trying to be good, it has ambition to be good, but it's not quite that good. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, your taste is still killer. Your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you're making is kind of a disappointment to you. You can tell it's still sort of crappy.
>
> A lot of people never get past that phase. A lot of people, at that point, they quit. The thing I would say to you, with all my heart, is that most everybody I know who does interesting creative work, they went through a phase of years where they had really good taste, they could tell what they were making wasn't as good as they wanted it to be. They knew it fell short. [...] The most important possible thing you could do, is do a lot of work.

<h2 id="finding-my-voice">Finding my voice üó£</h2>

Establishing a distinct style is the most difficult part of podcasting. Before I started the podcast, I had a long list of podcast shows that I loved but no idea how to synthesize them into something that was suitable to my voice and content.

When I look back, it's pretty clear how much I course-corrected as each episode came out. I recently listened to the first episode again to understand how far the podcast developed. When juxtaposed against the final episode, it's clear how much more polished and tightly-edited the show grew over time. You can clearly hear these following changes, among many others:

- Less stilted and awkward narration
- Smoother transitions between speaking and music
- More varied and energetic speaking cadence
- Increased jokes and humorous tones

Translating these outcomes into some actionable takeaways:

1. **Solo narration is hard:** After the first episode, I quickly abandonded the "one person talking"-style of podcasting. Some can do it [really](https://www.ridehome.info/podcast/techmeme-ride-home/) [well](http://www.thelandofdesire.com/), but I can't seem to recreate a casual, conversational tone when I'm locked in a closet by myself with a microphone. It was easier to have rapport with another person there, for both unprompted and prompted conversation, and I think the show becomes much more fun to listen to because of this change.

2. **Mold the recorded audio however you see fit**: At the beginning, I was loathe to cut or rearrange any recorded audio. It felt like I needed to be true to the original recording process and the natural flow of conversation. Slowly, I realized the final audio sounded much better if I was willing to construct episodes wholecloth, taking pieces of recordings from all over the discussion and mercilessly cutting out uninteresting dead weight. Oftentimes, our discussions would meander and backtrack, which was fun as a participant in the discussion, but less so for the audience. Listeners prefer coherent groupings of topics and streamlined discussion. This focus on the audience mindset is helpful cultivate even during the recording.

> Never stop thinking about pacing. If an answer seems boring, politely move things along. Charm. Cajole. React with amazement when they say something amazing. Laugh if they‚Äôre funny. Don‚Äôt forget that **YOU** are part of the interview.
>
> -- Jessica Abel, _Out on the Wire_

<ol start="3">
<li><p><strong>Steal liberally from your favorite podcasts:</strong> I was initially worried that it would be obvious which podcasts I was copying, so I avoided it. But after trying it once, I realized you could hardly tell. So much of a podcast's unique style depends on the voice of the host and a different person saying the same lines feels completely different. Plus, no one commented or cared.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Listen to podcasts you don't like:</strong> I honestly found it more helpful to refine my style by listening to "bad" shows versus good ones. I could easily hear things I wanted to avoid in my podcast and adjusted accordingly. I won't namedrop these shows, since to each his own in terms of podcasting style.</p></li>
</ol>

In the end, the most effective strategy for developing my voice was just to **do a lot of work.** Just as Ira Glass said, my output significantly improved by simply finishing and releasing many podcast episodes. I experimented with many different ways of recording, layering in sounds, and cutting together the audio. At every step, I tried to improve the podcast voice just a little bit more, and slowly the show inched closer to a final sound that I could be happy with.

I'm nowhere near done learning about my storytelling style---after all, I've only been through the German forest once!---but I'm leaps and bounds better than before.

<h2 id="musical-framing">Musical framing</h2>

Music was the most rewarding part of the editing process for me. I personally feel that the right music can elevate an episode from a decent one to something truly great. Getting the music perfect was also important to the show's content --- Japan actually has a very distinct soundscape, and I learned that the including music and background noise at the right time could make the stories more evocative to our audience.

It took me a while to settle on a mood and consistent tone for the music. Eventually the show's musical identity coalesced around **bright, synth-pop** that uses pentatonic scales and vaguely Asian themes. I was lucky to find an amazing artist [Bad Snacks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBCI_QCAMe1hx8UNyvJlM_Q) that I used heavily throughout the podcast for transitioning between different talking segments. And besides transition points, I also used music as backing tracks to suggest specific moods. I kept returning to the same few composers, since it was the easiest way to ensure a consistent sound.

<p class="video-subtitle">The most-used song from Bad Snacks was <i>Mizuki</i>, incorporated in four different episodes.</p>


I also recommend experimenting with [Foley sound effects](https://podcasters.spotify.com/blog/how-foley-can-enrich-your-podcasts-soundscape) to make the final audio more engaging. Since our episodes were all conversation-based, I used sound effects primarily to delineate recollections or recounting of events. This auditory "bookmarking" made it easier to distinguish storytelling sections from the other parts of the discussion, such as when we were back-and-forth debating or making jokes.

Here is a shortlist of the five best clips from the podcast. These showcase the impact of combining sound effects and background music with our recorded conversation audio. I am particularly proud of how I synced the rhythm of our speech to the beat of the music. You can also tell the quality progression of the editing, as the sound balance and timing of the various sound tracks improves:

In the end, the following groups contributed the most to the show's final musical sound:

My favorite compliment about the show was from a friend who said that the final episode had very "professional-sounding music." It felt great because of how much time and care I took in choosing and layering in the music. Quoting again from the unbeatable wisdom of _Out on the Wire_:

> Music is the frame around the picture. It makes it more real than real. More than just two guys talking.
