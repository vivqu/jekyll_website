Searching for a new job is stressful. It falls into the category of activities that are deeply frustrating yet unavoidable. 
We spend a huge number of waking hours at a full-time job, so it pays off to be thoughtful and thorough when choosing a new role. 

Perhaps you are one of the lucky ones that enjoys the job search process. But for me it is something to be suffered 
through---a perfectly awful combination of uncertainty, awkward communication, intense scrutiny, and judgement from industry peers. 

Interviewing for an engineering position is not as bad as other roles, in that there is generally more objectivity in the process. 
That does not mean engineering is a perfectly meritocratic system, though. In fact, there is *plenty* of proof that subjective evaluation goes 
on all the time. Every phase of the interview process has been called out as inefficient, [impacted](https://www.wired.com/2013/03/hiring-women/) 
by cognitive biases, and not a realistic assessment of the day-to-day reality of being an effective programmer. And the process is difficult 
in the other direction too. I've seen friends and coworkers join companies only to find themselves bored or unhappy, despite genuinely expecting otherwise.

# The need for a rigorous approach

Given this state of affairs, I wanted to be very methodical in my job search. I had just returned from 
[living in Japan](/blog/2019/07/12/simulated-annealing#jumping-a-year-abroad-in-japan) for a year, so I wasn't up-to-date on all the best 
career opportunities and new startups. My knowledge of compensation and market rate for my experience level was stale. It was also my 
first search as a senior engineer; the last time I looked for jobs I was a fresh-faced college grad. I luckily had a diverse set of 
skills that I could leverage, meaning I had no idea exactly what type of role I wanted. And I was in the privileged position to 
have enough savings, and a partner who quickly got a new job with irritating ease, to be able to take my time with the job search.

All signs indicated that I should apply to a broad set of companies and roles. This would give me a good overview of the industry landscape 
and clarify my own preferences at the same time. Then, assuming things went well, I could winnow down my choices and eventually 
select the most interesting, best-suited role. All the information I collected should also theoretically help with any future job searches.

What optimism. In the rest of this post, I attempt to document the methods I used and the learnings I gained.

<br />

# Maximizing the number of applications

My initial plan was to apply to all companies that even remotely satisfied my requirements, even if the company seemed clearly worse than 
other options I was considering. Maximizing the top of the job search funnel was important because:

- The job search process has bad signal-to-noise ratio
- Interviewing is a skill improved by practice and experience
- Some important information can only be discovered within the process
- Negotiation is a numbers game

### Bad signal-to-noise ratio

Out of all the companies I applied to, I was only going to receive offers from a very tiny fraction. Like I mentioned at the beginning of this
post, companies often reject candidates for reasons that have nothing to do with their competence or ability. I failed to move forward 
with several companies because:

- The recruiters were unresponsive
- The role was just filled
- The company wanted a specific skill set, despite the job posting saying otherwise
- My application wasn't a "good fit" and no other reason was given

And even if you pass the initial application screen, the later stages are also highly lossy. I have been an interviewer for years and sat in on 
many candidate debrief sessions, so I know how interviewers can be inexperienced or plain bad. New interviewers are sometimes given only two 
interviewing sessions with a partner before the company greenlights them to start evaluating candidates on their own. Improving at being
an interviewer is often not prioritized: engineers are not given resources or support by the company, or are too overwhelmed with their normal 
work to properly devote time and attention. 

And just because an interviewer is experienced doesn't necessarily mean they are necessarily good at conducting an interview, or at interviewing 
all types of candidates. Interviewers are incentivized to avoid false positives, since a bad hire can be disastrous to the team and maybe 
even the business. They receive little to no feedback when they pass on a candidate who would have been extremely successful at the company.

### Interview experience

On the other side of the process, interviewing is also a skill that can be improved. There has been a lot already written about how to study and
practice for technical interviews, so I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader. But study and mock interviews don't perfectly replicate
the conditions of a real technical interview. I was rusty at being an interview candidate, and I find I personally need to go through a few 
real interviews before I stop getting anxious and nervous beforehand. Having a wide diversity of job applications meant I could be thoughtful
about my ordering and try to put the companies I was less excited first, when I would have the highest chance of failing the technical screens.

### Personal requirements and compensation

Finally, maximizing the applications helped me better evaluate the job opportunities. Certain attributes that I value---such as working with
great people on my team and whether I would have a supportive, effective direct manager---could only be discovered during the interview process. 
I was frequently surprised at how my estimation of a company changed dramatically throughout the process. Having many conversations with companies 
helped me refine my questions and better determine if the role fit my own priorities. 

And then there's the problem with compensation. Companies will routinely undervalue candidates if they can get away with it, so negotiation is
very important. One of the most effective ways to negotiate is to have other competing offers. Since I would only receive offers from
a small fraction of the overall companies, going through the process with more companies leads to higher downstream negotiating power. Although 
maximizing my compensation was not one of my goals, I want to be paid fairly. There is repeated evidence that women in tech negotiate less,
are disadvantaged during compensation discussion (for both negotiating and not negotiating), and receive lower salary and equity compensation
relative to their male peers. I wanted to do as much as I could to gather leverage and push back against these systemic problems.

# My job search in numbers

The whole process took me seven weeks end-to-end, starting on October 15th and ending December 2nd. I applied to 43 tech companies and 
received five full-time offers.

### Applying to companies

While reaching out to 43 companies may seem unmanageable, this part of the process was actually pretty easy. I used the following channels to 
find companies:

- Directly applied to known companies
- Contacted alumni recruiter from previous companies
- Responded to recent recruiting emails and LinkedIn messages
- Looked at aggregated job posting sites like [key:values](https://www.keyvalues.com/) and [AngelList](https://angel.co/)
- Consulted ad hoc lists like [Breakout List 2019](https://breakoutlist.com/) and [Hiring Without Whiteboards](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards)
- Filtered the companies of my first- and second-degree connections on LinkedIn
- Referred to companies by friends and former coworkers

In terms of job titles, I was open to applying to any roles that fit my background and experience, though the resulting set skewed
heavily towards iOS roles.

<br />

*Breakdown of job roles. The "mobile" designation refers to positions where the mobile stack was still undefined. Growth
engineering was a mix of iOS and full-stack roles.*

<br />

I was interested in diversifying my product experience and working on more enterprise SaaS businesses. Unfortunately, most companies
actively hiring mobile engineers are consumer-facing so only 18.6% of the companies I applied to were B2B companies.

I did explicitly want to evaluate companies all across the size spectrum. I initially started out with a slight preference towards small to 
medium-sized companies with 100 engineers or less, but size of company ended up being evenly distributed at every stage of the interview process. 
Having final offers from small, medium, and huge companies gave me a really good sense of market rate compensation for my experience level. 

<br />
![company_size](/assets/img/posts/job-search/company-size.png)
*Companies by size: small (<50 engineers), medium (50-150), large (150-1000), and huge (1000+).*

<br />

Company valuation wasn't specifically a criteria I optimized for when applying for positions. It turns out to be pretty
evenly allocated since valuation is heavily correlated with the company size in the tech industry. More successful companies have 
more money raised, which means they can scale up by hiring more people.

<br />
![company_valuation](/assets/img/posts/job-search/company-valuation.png)
*Companies by valuation. Unicorns are companies valued at $1-10B and decacorns are valued at $10-50B.*

<br />

Company size and valuation, of course, is ultimately tied to the types of compensation offers you will receive. I'll cover my thoughts about
compensation in a subsequent post. Just know that it's challenging to compare offers from companies of drastically different sizes, since each
can argue about upside and risk in a way that makes their offer seem better.

<br />

### Scheduling and time management

In my opinion, the hardest part of the job search is time management. Sending out a large amount of applications to companies is easy; it's 
coordinating the subsequent recruiter calls, phone interviews, and scheduling time for take-home assessments while eating and still
generally living your life that is challenging.

**I went to a dinner party during the middle of my job search. Someone asked me what I did for work and I jokingly responded, "I'm a 
full-time interview candidate."**

But now looking back on the data, it wasn't a joke: I really did spend the equivalent time of a full-time job to do all my interviewing.
It seems like it should have been relatively easy to handle each stage of the job search since I was halving the number of companies at every 
step in the funnel. However, I was managing multiple stages of the process all at once and trying not to overload myself with
the stress of continuous interviewing.

<br />
![interview_burndown](/assets/img/posts/job-search/burndown.png)
*My progression of the interview stages at various companies over time.*

<br />

The burndown chart shows that I spent most of the seven weeks juggling four different phases of interviewing. I clearly spent way too 
long in the emailing and initial recruiter calls, even as I started approaching the end of my overall job search. I did cut all the
early-stage companies as soon as I scheduled my first onsite, but I could have been doing so much earlier. I should have started 
judiciously dropping companies starting as early as 1.5 weeks in, to ease my schedule and focus on the companies where I had already
progressed to later stages.

Even as my personal sales pitch to recruiters improved and I regained all my skills at technical interviewing, I could only handle doing 
so many interviews in one day. The worst day was either when I scheduled two coffee chats in the morning and three recruiter calls in the 
afternoon, or did two different back-to-back technical phone screens as well as another recruiter call later that same day. 

A lot of the difficulty with time management came from the fact that interview scheduling is very one-sided. Recruiters and 
interview coordinators ask you to provide huge blocks of time to make it easier for them to schedule their hiring managers and 
engineers internally. This is normally not a problem when you're interviewing at just a handful of companies, but if you're 
playing on hard mode like me, handling dozens of simultaneous interview processes makes it challenging to provide big 
blocks of time while still load balancing for my own energy.

### Variance in process length and offer deadlines

Each company also operates its own interview process timeline, and the durations can vary wildly. One recruiter told me that the average 
time from initial phone call to onsite took 3-4 weeks. Another said that the company could wrap up their entire process, including getting
me the offer letter, in under two weeks.

<br />
![process_by_company](/assets/img/posts/job-search/process-by-company.png)
*A snapshot of the range of hiring processes at the companies I interviewed with.*

<br />

It was therefore challenging to properly schedule the various companies to make sure I was making progress at the _same rate_. I wanted
to finish final onsites for companies within two weeks. By clustering the onsites close together, I could hopefully receive my offers and
be able to evaluate them together to make my decision. While none of the companies had exploding offers or hard deadlines, it felt unfair
to ask certain companies to wait longer because their process resolved faster. Perhaps I could have been slightly less sympathetic to
the companies that had already extended me offers, since I ended up making more stress for myself by scheduling three company onsites 
in the same week.

The graph above also shows the dramatic benefits of referrals. My former coworker worked at Company I, and from his strong referral, 
the recruiter let me know I could skip the phone interview and directly proceed to the onsite. Referrals ended up being a great way 
to add more companies into my pipeline without requiring hours of additional scheduling to go through the early stages. Since
I didn't realize the difficulty of coordination and scheduling, I missed the opportunity to leverage my network for more referrals during
this job search.

# Future job searches

After a grueling seven weeks, I can report that I was pretty satisfied with my approach. I was able to think through many of my 
assumptions and requirements for a new job role. I learned about a wide range of products and interesting technology. I also 
met many really smart peers and managers, and I hope I can stay in touch with many of them.

I will probably not be attempting such a massive job pipeline next time around. My best advice is to try this time-consuming 
rigorous approach once or twice in your career if you can. Quit your job and treat searching for a new job as your new full-time role, 
in order to gain confidence about your decision-making process, expand the set of companies you consider, and get really good at 
interviewing through sheer volume of experience.
