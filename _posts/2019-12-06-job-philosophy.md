And even if you pass the initial application screen, the later stages are also highly lossy. I have been an interviewer for years and sat in on 
many candidate debrief sessions, so I know how interviewers can be inexperienced or plain bad. New interviewers are sometimes given only two 
interviewing sessions with a partner before the company greenlights them to start evaluating candidates on their own. Improving at being
an interviewer is often not prioritized: engineers are not given resources or support by the company, or are too overwhelmed with their normal 
work to properly devote time and attention. 

And just because an interviewer is experienced doesn't necessarily mean they are necessarily good at conducting an interview, or at interviewing 
all types of candidates. Interviewers are incentivized to avoid false positives, since a bad hire can be disastrous to the team and maybe 
even the business. They receive little to no feedback when they pass on a candidate who would have been extremely successful at the company.

### Interview experience

On the other side of the process, interviewing is also a skill that can be improved. There has been a lot already written about how to study and
practice for technical interviews, so I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader. But study and mock interviews don't perfectly replicate
the conditions of a real technical interview. I was rusty at being an interview candidate, and I find I personally need to go through a few 
real interviews before I stop getting anxious and nervous beforehand. Having a wide diversity of job applications meant I could be thoughtful
about my ordering and try to put the companies I was less excited first, when I would have the highest chance of failing the technical screens.

### Personal requirements and compensation

Finally, maximizing the applications helped me better evaluate the job opportunities. Certain attributes that I value---such as working with
great people on my team and whether I would have a supportive, effective direct manager---could only be discovered during the interview process. 
I was frequently surprised at how my estimation of a company changed dramatically throughout the process. Having many conversations with companies 
helped me refine my questions and better determine if the role fit my own priorities. 

And then there's the problem with compensation. Companies will routinely undervalue candidates if they can get away with it, so negotiation is
very important. One of the most effective ways to negotiate is to have other competing offers. Since I would only receive offers from
a small fraction of the overall companies, going through the process with more companies leads to higher downstream negotiating power. Although 
maximizing my compensation was not one of my goals, I want to be paid fairly. There is repeated evidence that women in tech negotiate less,
are disadvantaged during compensation discussion (for both negotiating and not negotiating), and receive lower salary and equity compensation
relative to their male peers. I wanted to do as much as I could to gather leverage and push back against these systemic problems.
