# Some thoughts on compensation

### Company size vs. compensation

Note that it was difficult to negotiate between my offers since overall compensation value is hard to compare when company size is dramatically different. 
The smaller the company, the higher the proportion of compensation is offered in stock options or RSUs. The risk and upside of that paper money is ultimately 
subjective, especially if you try and compare it to the stock compensation at huge, post-IPO companies. For those looking for optimal negotiating leverage, 
I would recommend trying to receive offers from companies that are at about the same size or stage of growth. And if you are looking to join startups, make 
sure you do proper due diligence on how to value early employee stock options.

### Crowdsource compensation

One piece of advice I'd recommend to anyone starting their job search is to **crowdsource compensation data from your network.**  I reached out to 
close friends and former coworkers around the same experience level and asked if they were willing to share their current compensation. This is
doubly effective if those coworkers just recently interviewed and received offers themselves. In return, I offered to share the offers I 
received after I wrapped up my job search.

Asking someone about their compensation is very uncomfortable and many people avoid it because of the social stigma. But this discomfort and lack of 
information strictly benefits the companies, since they can hire and retain talent for less than the individual could theoretically ask for. So it makes 
sense to share since we all can more effectively negotiate our salaries. I was pleasantly surprised that everyone I asked was willing to share 
their compensation information.

If you're still feeling uncomfortable about asking, here is the template that I used:

>  Hey [NAME], I'm currently looking for jobs right now. I know you recently just went through the job search yourself. If you don't mind sharing what your 
> [COMPANY] offer was, or what you did to negotiate the offer, that would be super helpful. I'm also happy to share the offers that I get. I'd love to
> buy you a coffee and chat in person, but also no problem if you prefer not to share!

I was able to get pretty accurate information from my network and use it during negotiation. This information was sometimes up to a year old, but in some cases
it turned out to be more effective than negotiating with my other offers since I could more effectively argue using data from another company at the same size.
