<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This policy describes the information that I, Vivian Qu, may receive from Haiku app users and how that information is handled.</p>
<p>What I want, what’s most important to me, is:</p>
<div class="ml-6">
    <ul><li>To be able to identify and fix crashes & bugs in the app.</li>
        <li>To log traffic to this website and view in aggregate.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>In other words, I don’t want any private information — except for what is necessary information to be able to identify and fix crashes & bugs, and things like how many times the app has been downloaded.</p>
<p>Much of this policy was proudly copied directly from the <a href="https://superhighway.info/privacy.html" target="_blank">Information Superhighway</a> policy. I appreciated the conciseness and readability of IS's policy and thought it worthy of stealing.</p>

<h2>Crash Logs</h2>
<p>If you opt in to send crash logs to developers on iOS, both Apple and I will have copies of your crash logs.</p>
<p>Crash logs are created and stored by Apple, and I access them through Apple’s provided tools: App Store Connect and Xcode.</p>
<p>This data is collected only to facilitate fixing crashing bugs.</p>

<h2>Website Logging and Trackers</h2>
<p>Visits to the website are logged via anonymized Google Analytics. I am only interested in basic information like number of visitors to a particular blog post. You can read more about the website's general privacy policy <a href="/privacy">here</a>.</p>
